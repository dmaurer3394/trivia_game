# Tech Trivia

### A quick 10 question trivia game with GIFs and an endgame score counter.

Simply go to https://dmaurer3394.github.io/trivia_game/ and click the **start** button to get started.

### Game basics

- You have 30 seconds to answer each question. If you run out of time the question is counted as a wrong answer.

- Each question has a hint button you can click on. Using this has no impact on your score.

- Click on the answer you think is correct.

- You will either be shown a 'correct' or 'incorrect' slide with a random GIF

At the end of the game after all 10 questions have been displayed you're shown one of 4 different end cards depending on your score.

Once you're through and get to the end card, you're given the choice to go back through the game and thats it. It's just an easy trivia game based on technology with a funky design and funny GIFs. Enjoy.
